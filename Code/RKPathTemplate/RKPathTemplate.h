/**
 Design Points:

 * This is a subset of the URI Template format. It does not support query parameters. Only paths and simple variables.
 * Templates are of the form "/static_segment/{variable_segment}/" vs old format of "/static/:variable"
 * Templates such as "/people/{personID}.json" should work.
 * Drop dependence on SOCKit. Use `NSScanner` or `NSRegularExpression` for underlying implementation.
 * Matches are exact. There must be the same number of segments in the pattern as the inputted path for a match to evaluate.
 * Should have a decent implementation of `isEqual:` and `hash` so that this can be used in a
 * This can be spun out into a standalone library. In fact you can build it in a seperate repository if you want.
 * Take a look at CSURITemplate to see what the full enchilada is like.
 * This replaces `RKPathMatcher`. See its implementation and test cases for reference
